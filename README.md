# Fresh Kicks
Our Group assignment was good as we had some challenges to overcome. Our web app is a shoe 
website that allows you to purchase the latest shoes on the market whilst making them very 
affordable to our customers. In the latter part of this document we’ll explain what segments of 
our code do to our website. When the code is run the user will see discounts on sneakers of their 
choice. We came up with the idea by thinking of our favourite things and said “why not a shoe 
webapps”. This is a great choice because people of our generation love sneakers especially 
Jordan’s so we know that web app will be great to ensure good sales which will lead to best 
incomes as college students. 

Our website uses a navigation bar and an alternative background styling element is organized by 
the index.html file. The <div class=”background”></div> indicate a placeholder for future 
background styling or content. Using Bootstrap classes (navbar, navbar-expand-lg, navbar-light, 
and bg-light) and a subdued box shadow effect, the <nav> section creates a responsive navigation bar. It has a collapsed container (navbar-collapse) that encloses a list of navigation 
elements (<ul>, <li>) and links (<a>) styled as the company logo, Home, Cart, and About 
sections, as well as a collapsible button (navbar-toggler) for smaller screens. These links use 
Font Awesome symbols to graphically represent each component of the website and point 
readers to “about.html “ and “cart.html” among other relevant pages.

The login file for our website compromises of functions which are in JavaScript, we have a call 
create account() and this function is responsible for the names, addresses, email, phone and 
passwords our users. This helps us to get users trust when shopping for the best sneakers so they 
can have a secure account when visiting the website again.
